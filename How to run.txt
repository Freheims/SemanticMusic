HOW TO RUN THE PROJECT

A live and running version of the project can be viewed at http://semanticmusic.xyz

There are two ways the code can be run. Either you can host and run everything locally or you can use our database.
If you want to have everything locally you follow these steps.

1. Add Apache-jena and jena-fuseki libraries to /resources/libs/apache.

2. pip3 install spotipy in /resources.

3. Set up a MYSQL-database named "spotify" with the tables as specified in /resources/database.sql

4 Then you must change user credentials and host in the corresponding fields in resources/spotifyData.py and resources/Semantics/src/database/DbCredentials.java to what you set them to in MYSQL. (The folder /resources/Semantics is an IntelliJ project folder so it can be opened there or imported to Eclipse, or you can edit and compile the files mannualy)

5. Run /resources/spotifyData.py in Python 3.4 or newer. 

6. Run the createTriples main class in resources/Semantics

7. Start a fuseki server with the command "./fuseki-server --update --loc=/../../../MYTDB /ds &" from /resources/libs/apache/jena-fuseki../ And populate it with the tripleStore.nt with the command "s-put http://localhost:3030/ds/data default ../../../tripleStore.nt" from the same place. 

8. Now you can test the project by opening /web/index.html in your browser.



If you just want to use our database just do the following steps from the guide above:
